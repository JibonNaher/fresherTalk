About fresherTalk
##############

We used php and mysql for back-end and html and css for the front-end design. We used Codeignitor (MVC) framework for our project. The controllers, models and views files are all inside the application folder. Our main file is WelcomePageC.php, our site starts running from this page. Our database file is fresherTalkDatabase.sql The images we used are in the images folder, in the same directory as application folder.
